App Update Requirements

Custom Email Name (User Feature)

Allow users to create a custom email name using any available domain.

For example, if the admin has added 3 domains to the system, the user should be able to choose a domain and enter their own custom email name.

Blog Management System (Admin Panel)

Improve the blog feature so the admin can create and manage multiple blog posts.

Each blog post should support:

A featured image

Rich content using a powerful content editor

Meta title and meta description fields for SEO

Ensure featured images display correctly on blog cards on the frontend.

Site Settings (Admin Panel)

Add a General Settings section where the admin can manage:

Site name

Site logo

Default meta title

Default meta description

Pages Management

Ensure Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, and Blog pages work properly.

The admin should be able to update the content of these pages easily from the admin panel.

Contact Us Form

All contact form submissions should be stored in the admin panel.

The admin should be able to view and manage all submissions properly.

SMTP Configuration

Add an option to send a test email from the SMTP settings page.

This will allow the admin to verify that the SMTP configuration is working correctly.

Password Recovery System

Implement a proper “Forgot Password” system so users can easily reset and update their passwords.

Homepage & Dynamic Content Management (Admin Panel)

Allow the admin to update all homepage content, including:

FAQ section

Random email creation messages

Received email messages

Active user and uptime content

All content should be editable according to the admin’s requirements.

Advertisements Management

In the ads section, display demo ad placeholders (e.g., 214×33 banner sizes) so the admin knows which ad sizes are supported.

Allow the admin to hide demo ads.

When the admin adds real ad code, display the real ad instead of the demo placeholder.

Welcome Email

Send a branded welcome email to users upon registration.

The email should include the site logo and site name.
