App Update Requirements

Please implement the following updates and enhancements in the application:

1. UI & Theme

In mobile view, display icons only on buttons so that all buttons appear in a single row without breaking the layout.

Set Light Mode as the default theme instead of Dark Mode.

2. Admin Content Management

Provide admin access to manage and update the following content from the admin panel:

Terms & Conditions

Privacy Policy

Footer content, including:

“All Rights Reserved” text

Social media icon links

Remove the API Documentation link from the footer.

3. Logo Management

Allow the admin to upload custom logos for both the header and footer via the admin panel.

Hide the default Temp Mail logo, icon, and text.

Display the admin-uploaded logo in both the header and footer instead of the default branding.

4. Contact Form (Important)

When a user submits the contact form:

Save all submission data to the database.

Allow the admin to view, manage, and export submissions from the admin panel.

Display submissions in a clean, organized, and user-friendly format.

Additionally:

Send the contact form submission details to the admin email in a well-designed, formatted email.

Add a Contact Settings section in the admin panel where the admin can define the email address for receiving contact form notifications.

5. Email Templates (Most Important)

Add a dedicated Email Templates tab in the admin panel.

Allow the admin to create and manage custom email templates for:

Welcome Email

Forgot Password Email

Contact Form Submission Notification

Newsletter Subscription Confirmation

Email Editor Requirements

Include a Notes / Help section in each email editor explaining available variables/placeholders (e.g., {{username}}, {{email}}, {{message}}) and how to use them.

If the admin does not create a custom email template:

Automatically use a default system email template that includes:

Site logo

Clean and professional layout

Properly formatted email content

Replace plain text links in emails with styled buttons for improved user experience.

6. Newsletter Subscription

When a user enters their email in the footer newsletter section and clicks Subscribe:

Send a thank-you confirmation email to the user.

The email should be in a beautiful, professional format and include the site logo.
