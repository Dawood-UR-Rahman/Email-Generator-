App Update – Required Changes

Please implement the following updates in the application:

1. Custom Domain Visibility

A custom domain should be visible only to the user who added it.

Other logged-in users must not be able to see or use another user’s custom domain.

2. Custom Domain Instructions

In the Admin Panel, add the ability to add and update domain connection instructions (e.g., How to Connect Your Domain).

Ensure that any updates made by the admin are automatically reflected in the user panel.

3. Database Storage Management (Admin Panel)

Add a new tab in the admin panel called “Manage Database Storage.”

From this tab, the admin should be able to:

Configure automatic deletion of temporary emails and messages after a specified time period.

Set a data limit to automatically clean temporary mail and message records for better database performance.

Manually delete all temporary emails and messages using a single action button (Create / Delete buttons for maintenance tasks).

4. User Management (Admin Panel)

In the Users section of the admin panel:

Display a list of all users.

Provide options to:

Log in as a user

Edit user details

Delete users

Enable full CRUD operations for user management.

5. Contact Submissions & Email Branding

Display all contact form submissions properly in the Contact section of the admin panel.

When the system sends emails via SMTP:

Show the website name (set by the admin) in the email header instead of generic “Admin” text.

6. Logo Management Across the System

In the User Panel (Frontend):

Display the logo set by the admin instead of the default logo.

In the Admin Panel:

Display the admin-uploaded logo instead of the default logo.

If no logo is set by the admin:

Use a new system default logo.

7. Custom Domain Limits & Plans

Add a new admin panel tab called “Manage Custom Domains.”

Allow the admin to:

Set the maximum number of custom domains allowed for free users.

If a user reaches the limit:

Prevent adding more custom domains.

Display a message such as:
“Please purchase a plan to add more custom domains and create permanent email addresses.”
